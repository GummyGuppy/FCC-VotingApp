# FCC-VotingApp

A dynamic voting application that is inspired by the FreeCodeCamp Voting Application project. 

##### The database is hosted by mlab.com, a MongoDB DaaS website.


##  Current ToDo's:
  
  1)  Develop Poll schema, model, and properly learn how to manupulate data from the database.
  2) Implement the data into a new barchart


## User Stories
  (completed user stories will have a strikethrough)
- As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.
- As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.
- As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.
- As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.
- As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.
- As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.
- As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)
- As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.
